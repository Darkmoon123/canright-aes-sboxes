# David Canright's tiny AES S-boxes

David Canright's designs.

(Note that these are *former* record-holders for AES S-boxes; [Rene
Peralta's](http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/peralta/CircuitStuff/CMT.html) are smaller.)

The Verilog sources have been linted; they have not been verified.

The C programs are slightly cleaned up.
